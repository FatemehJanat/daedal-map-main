Grant Analyzer - thin, country-keyed coordinator.

This file used to contain the entire US-specific implementation. As of
2026-06-29 it's a coordinator over two real backends with genuinely
different capabilities:

    us_backend.py  - full: discovery, precedent, readiness scoring,
                      live opportunity checks, writing templates
    can_backend.py - partial: discovery and precedent only (see its
                      CAPABILITIES dict) - no Canadian Grant Readiness
                      Score, writing template, or live-opportunity-check
                      exists yet

Why the split: an external architecture review (2026-06-29) flagged that
this module was accumulating US-specific assumptions (CFDA-keyed lookups,
USA-XX loc_id parsing) while nominally being country-agnostic, with no
second real backend to check that assumption against. Splitting now,
before a third country, keeps each backend's real capabilities honest
and visible instead of letting grant_analyzer.py grow a conditional limb
per country (the international/USAID branch already inside
us_backend.score_and_rank_programs was a live example of exactly that
pattern starting to happen).

No formal CountryGrantBackend interface exists yet - deliberately. With
one full implementation and one partial one, the real shared method
signatures aren't visible yet. Revisit once can_backend gets a real
scoring function (a second full implementation) - that's when the actual
shared shape between two complete backends becomes visible, instead of
guessed.

Usage:
    import grant_analyzer as ga
    ga.CAPABILITIES["CAN"]              # {'discovery': True, 'precedent': True, 'readiness_scoring': False, ...}
    backend = ga.get_backend("US")      # the us_backend module
    backend.match_grant_programs(...)

    # or, just as commonly, import the backend you need directly:
    import us_backend
    import can_backend
